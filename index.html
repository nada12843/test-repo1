  <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.com">Code First Girls</a>.Going over everything from how the 
  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>you can understand what is going on'under the hood'</li>
    <li>not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</li>
    <li>it's fun !</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><em>What do you need to create a website?</em></h3>
  <ul>
   <p>Not much!</P>
    <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using Atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using Chrome)</li>
    <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>
